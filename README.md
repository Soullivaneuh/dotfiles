# Personal dotfiles

Here is my personal dotfiles and a way to run one command installation.

## Installation

### Quick install (from void-linux)

Recommended to get all the needed packages installed for a working desktop OS.

```
sudo xbps-install -A curl
curl -L http://manjaro.sulli.cc | sh
```

### Manual

On your home directory (or anywhere else):

```
git clone git@github.com:Soullivaneuh/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
make install
```

For more information about the available commands:

```
make help
```
